EXERCISES

1. In your own words highlight the differences in functionality and purposes Client-Side and Server-Side code serves in a full-stack web application.

A:  The purpose of the client-side(browser) is to render dynamic web pages.  The purpose for the server is to serve the code for those web pages.  The Client-side sends requests to the server, retrieves data from it and interacts with local storage.  The Server-Side processes user input, responds to requests and interacts with the permanent storage(database). Additionally, client-side interfaces with HTML and the DOM while server-side does not.  Client-side uses AJAX to make HTTP requests while the server side can make direct HTTP requests.

2. What explains Nodes' rise in popularity and use? What does "Isomorphic JavaScript programming" mean? Provide some real-world examples not listed in this checkpoint of companies using Node.js.

A: Node.js is a powerful server-side JS platform for building fast, scalable network applications that is both lightweight and efficient.  It allows web application development to unify around a single programming language.  Isomorphic javascript is the fact that it can run code on both the server and client side.  Paypal, ebay and linkedin are some additional examples.
